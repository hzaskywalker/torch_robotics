## Current objective

- [hard ddl] CSE 291 homework
    - A model-based RL paper and its revision 
    - so that I can start the optimization methods ...
- Mujoco - Environment:
    - cartpole, halfcheetah, humanoid, __pusher__, swimmer
    - support ssh and off-screen render __DISPLAY=:1__ seems to work for X forward
    - support cluster ...
- Robotics - Environment:
    - MovoPush/Pick with position control
    - Inverse Kinematics with RL/HER
    - RL optimizer for goal conditioned RL..
- Model free RL baselines...
    - ppo
    - sac
    - DDPG/TD-3
- Model based RL
    - Performance of trajectory optimization on
        - Other mujoco environment (__humanoid standup__)
        - Sapien
    - POPLIN as a good baseline, but we need to check if it works on other environment ...
- Others
    - Zhizuo: I should involve in that
    - Chutong: what's sac's performance? Can we accelerate the performance with neural neworks?
    - Zhan: what should he do? Reimplement an optimization algorithm
    - Yingren: what's the progress ...
    - Yiran: what's the progress...


## Mujoco Environments
In this task, we should 1. run the environment on the ssh and render it to image. 2. run ppo/sac/TD3 and figure out the correct api on the server...

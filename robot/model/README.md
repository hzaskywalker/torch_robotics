# Models

We can use learn the model in several way.

Although we can include everything into a probabilistic framework, it's impossible to do it now.

Currently, I have planned to add the following baselines:

## Forward Models
- MLP
- VAE
- Graph Neural Network

## Energy-based/Optimization based Models
- Conv1D
